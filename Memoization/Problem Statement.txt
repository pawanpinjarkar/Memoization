Given a number n, find the number of different ways to write n as a sum of 1, 3 and 4. You only have to output the number of different
partitions - not the actual partitions itself. Run your program on 5 integer inputs of sizes >=10^5. 
Provide the inputs on which you ran the program and the corresponding number of partitions for each input. 
Be careful with the initial conditions. Following is a toy example.

Input: 5
Output: 6 partitions
1. 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 2. 1+1+3
3. 1+3+1
4. 3+1+1
5. 4 + 1 6. 1 + 4
